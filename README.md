# Cinch

**A Basic Programming Language Designed for Simplicity and Ease**

---

## Introduction

*Cinch* is a straightforward and approachable programming language, designed to make coding a breeze for beginners and to provide a clean, efficient syntax for all programmers. Its goal is to allow you to write clear and concise code without the burden of unnecessary complexity.

---

## Basic Syntax Rules

### 1. Variable Declaration and Visibility

- Variables are declared using the keyword `var`.
- **Private variables** begin with an underscore `_` (e.g., `_secret`).
- **Public variables** have no underscore prefix.

```cinch
var _secretNumber: int = 42    // Private variable
var userName: string = "User" // Public variable
```

### 2. No Semicolons

- Statements do **not** require semicolons at the end.

### 3. Control Structures Without Brackets

- Blocks are defined by indentation or new lines, **no brackets `{}`** required.
- Supported control structures: `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while`.

### 4. Functions

- Declared using the `func` keyword.
- Parameters and return types are optional but encouraged.
- Functions use indentation to define their body.

### 5. Printing and Input

- Use `print()` to display output.
- Use `input()` to get user input as a string.

## File Extension

- Save *Cinch* programs with the extension `.cinch`.
